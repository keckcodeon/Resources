Learning R: 2019 Summer Workshop for NYU CDSC Lab
=================================================

##### Meeting time: Tuesdays from 1:30 to 3 pm (beginning June 11) | Instructor: Kelsey Moty

This workshop will help you to learn the fundamentals of R needed to
manipulate, visualize, and describe your data. This workshop has a
particular emphasis on producing clean and reproducible code in line
with coding and open science best practices. Due to time limitations, we
will not be able to go over how to do statistical modeling in R;
however, I will provide a series of resources at the end of this list
that you can look over on your own.\
\
Some of these resources may at times be redundant with one another. Feel
free to skip over material that you feel comfortable with. Most
importantly, make sure to work through the exercises! The best way to
learn how to code is by actually coding :)\
\
Each week, we will meet for an hour and half to go over the topic for
that week. This meeting is meant to be collaborative. You will work
together with other people in our lab to get started with each week's R
skill. However, you will also need to complete some of the lesson on
your own time, as an hour and half is likely not enough time to practice
that week's topic. If questions come up outside of our Tuesday meeting,
feel free to post them on the R Workshop Slack channel!\
\
You will get to apply the skills learned in this workshop to a dataset
from a research project you are currently working on in the lab. At the
end of the workshop, you will share with other members of the lab the
dataset you cleaned up, a plot you created from that dataset, and some
kind of analysis you did on that dataset (whether descriptive or
inferential).

\
##### Before we begin, this workshop pulls from resources written by a lot of amazing people and they deserve credit for it!

A number of the book chapters and other resources we are reading were
written by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/), [Danielle
Navarro](https://compcogscisydney.org/), [Jenny
Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/), [Jim
Hester](https://www.jimhester.com/), [Kieran
Healy](https://kieranhealy.org/), and [Andy
Fields](https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/about/). Several of the
tutorials we are working through are from a course that was taught by
[Dale
Barr](https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/staff/dalebarr/)
and [Lisa DeBruine](https://debruine.github.io/).

Moving forward: Other things you should learn about R:

</div>

Introductory statistics
<div class="panel">

*Reading:* [Learning statistics with R: A tutorial for psychology
students](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/): Great book for
learning how to do the stats from an introductory stats course in R\

*Book:* [Discovering statistics with
R](assets/discoveringstatistics.pdf): Covers similar content as
*Learning statistics with R* plus much more\
*Exercises:* [Interactive tutorials for learning how to do statistics in
R](http://milton-the-cat.rocks/home/adventr.html) (companion to [An
Adventure in
Statistics](https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/books/an-adventure-in-statistics/),
a book by Andy Fields. Book is not free, but the tutorials are!)\

</div>

Advanced statistics
<div class="panel">

**Frequentist approaches:**

\
**Bayesian approaches:**

</div>

Best coding practices
<div class="panel">

*Reading:* [Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/): How to write
code that is easy for you and others to read\

</div>

Advanced topics in R
<div class="panel">

**Improve your programming skills and gain a deep understanding of the R
language:**\

**Manipulating strings and pattern matching in R using regular
expressions:**

**data.table: An alternative approach for wrangling data**\
You may be asking: if I can already wrangle my data using tidyverse, why
learn another approach? While I personally prefer to use tidyverse or
baseR functions for manipulating data (I find these approaches to be
more readable and user-friendly), data.table is a more efficient
codebase. That is, code using data.table runs more quickly, which is
particularly useful when working with large datasets. Many psychology
researchers wouldn't notice any gains in speed by implementing their
code using data.table (our datasets just aren't the big). But! If you
work with big datasets (like hundreds of thousands to millions of lines
of data), data.table can help speed up data processing.

</div>

Simulating data using R
<div class="panel">

**When pre-registering your study, one best practice is to also
pre-register all the R code you will use for your analyses. How do you
write code without data? One way: simulate a dataset and use that data
as you work through your analyses.**\

General Resources
=================

\
### Cheat sheets

[Various cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
on a range of topics, from
[dplyr](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#dplyr),
[ggplot](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#ggplot2), [R
Markdown](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#rmarkdown), and
more!\
\
### Books / Tutorials

[psyTeachR](https://psyteachr.github.io/): Great resource that provides
a number of interactive books and tutorials for doing reproducible
research in R. This website covers a broad range of topics on data
cleaning, visualization, reproducible workflows, and more. From their
website: "Our curriculum now emphasizes essential ‘data science’
graduate skills that have been overlooked in traditional approaches to
teaching, including programming skills, data visualisation, data
wrangling and reproducible reports. Students learn about probability and
inference through data simulation as well as by working with real
datasets.""
