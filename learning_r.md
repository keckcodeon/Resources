## Advanced statistics

**Frequentist approaches:** *Reading + exercises:* [Mixed models in R:](https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R) Tutorial on how to build mixed models in R (best for people who already have some understanding of what mixed models are)
*Exercises:* [Interactive tutorials on statistics in R](http://milton-the-cat.rocks/home/adventr.html) (includes tutorials on
multilevel models and growth models)
*Reading:* [Psychometrics in R](http://www.personality-project.org/r/book/)
*Reading:* [Exploring interactions using \`interactions\` package:](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/interactions/vignettes/interactions.html)
Great package for exploring interactions, particularly interactions with
one or more continuous variables

**Bayesian approaches:** 
Book:* [Bayesian statistics in R](assets/kruschke_bayesian_in_R.pdf) (plus the [solutions for the book's exercises](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/exercises))
Best coding practices
*Reading:* [Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/): How to write code that is easy for you and others to read
Chapter 2: [General syntax style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html)
Chapter 4: [Style guide for using pipes](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html)
Advanced topics in R

**Improve your programming skills and gain a deep understanding of the R language:**
*Book:* [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/): Book on advanced topics
in R, including an more in-depth discussion on the foundations of R plus
chapters on functional programming, metaprogramming, and performant
code. If you can understand the concepts in this book, you will have a
strong foundation for learning any programming language.

**Manipulating strings and pattern matching in R using regular expressions:** 
*Reading + exercises:* [Book chapter on manipulating strings](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html)
*Reading + video tutorial:* [Base R functions for doing regular expressions](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/regular-expressions.html)
*Reading:* [Using stringr (a tidyverse package) for regular expressions](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/regular-expressions.html)
*Resource:* [Cheatsheet for basic regular expressions in R](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf)

**data.table: An alternative approach for wrangling data**
You may be asking: if I can already wrangle my data using tidyverse, why learn another approach? While I personally prefer to use tidyverse or
baseR functions for manipulating data (I find these approaches to be more readable and user-friendly), data.table is a more efficient
codebase. That is, code using data.table runs more quickly, which is particularly useful when working with large datasets. Many psychology
researchers wouldn't notice any gains in speed by implementing their code using data.table (our datasets just aren't the big). But! If you
work with big datasets (like hundreds of thousands to millions of lines of data), data.table can help speed up data processing. *Reading:*
[Introduction to data.table:](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html)
Vignette on data.table's syntax and to perform actions comparable to those in tidyverse's dplyr and tidyr packages
Simulating data using R **When pre-registering your study, one best practice is to also
pre-register all the R code you will use for your analyses. How do you
write code without data? One way: simulate a dataset and use that data
as you work through your analyses.**\
*Reading:* [Getting started simulating data in R](https://aosmith.rbind.io/2018/08/29/getting-started-simulating-data/):
Blog with a good introduction into some of the functions you will use
when simulating a dataset.
*Reading + exercises:* [Lab to practice simulating data using R](https://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/labs/simulation/Lab_3_simulation.html)\
*Slides + exercises:* [Slides on simulating data using R](http://had.co.nz/stat480/lectures/15-simulation.pdf): These slides
include a series of exercises to go through as you go along\
*Book:* [Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R](assets/simulation.pdf): This book assumes no prior experience in
programming or probability. Section 3 on Probability and Section 4 on
Simulation are the most relevant for those who already have experience
programming in R (i.e., you are familiar with earlier programming topics
discussed on this syllabus).\

General Resources
=================


### Cheat sheets

[Various cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) on a range of topics, from [dplyr](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#dplyr), [ggplot](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#ggplot2), [RMarkdown](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#rmarkdown), and more!

### Books / Tutorials

[psyTeachR](https://psyteachr.github.io/): Great resource that provides a number of interactive books and tutorials for doing reproducible
research in R. This website covers a broad range of topics on data cleaning, visualization, reproducible workflows, and more. From their
website: "Our curriculum now emphasizes essential ‘data science’ graduate skills that have been overlooked in traditional approaches to
teaching, including programming skills, data visualisation, data wrangling and reproducible reports. Students learn about probability and
inference through data simulation as well as by working with real datasets.""
